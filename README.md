## Naughthirium

#### Patches compatibility for Nothirium, with mods such as LoliASM.

**Compatible with RenderLib 1.4.1 + Nothirium 0.4.2 and above**

Current Patches:

1. Fixes compatibility with `LoliASM`'s `onDemandAnimatedTextures` for both blocks and entities. You are now allowed to benefit from both systems
2. Fixes compatibility with `ChunkAnimator` not being fully realized as initial render chunks are not queued for animation
3. Fixes compatibility with `Optifine`'s `Smart Animation` feature. If you have `LoliASM` installed, please update to at least version 5.23 or above
4. Fixes compatibility with `Multiblocked`'s custom renderer
