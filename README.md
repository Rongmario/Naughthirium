## Naughthirium

#### Patches compatibility for Nothirium, with mods such as LoliASM.

Current Patches:

1. Fixes compatibility with LoliASM's onDemandAnimatedTextures for both blocks and entities. You are now allowed to benefit from both systems.
2. Fixes compatibility with ChunkAnimator not being fully realized as initial render chunks are not queued for animation
