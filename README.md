## Naughthirium

#### Patches compatibility for Nothirium, with mods such as LoliASM.

Current Patches:

1. Fixes compatibility with `LoliASM`'s `onDemandAnimatedTextures` for both blocks and entities. You are now allowed to benefit from both systems.
2. Fixes compatibility with `ChunkAnimator` not being fully realized as initial render chunks are not queued for animation
3. Fixes compatibility between `LoliASM`, `Optifine` and `Nothirium`, you are now able to use `onDemandAnimatedTextures` properly when all 3 of the mods are installed with animated textures working as intended
